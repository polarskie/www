		<h2>An introduction to Halftone QRcode Embroider</h2>
		<img src="test.bmp" alt="your browser can't display a bmp file" style="float:right; padding:0.5em">
		<p>
			QRcode has been a very frequently used 2D code for quick access to websites or
article messages. But the black and white blocks look ugly. There are already some work
done by researchers which embellishes the QRcode by trying to combine it with a halftone
picture. But the outcome is not so satisfying, both on the recognition rate and on the
resolution of the picture. My work was to find a better algorithm for the original aim.</p>
<p>
The existing algorithm works by dividing every black and white block of the QRcode into
a matrix of 3×3 smaller blocks, and maintain the central smaller block right the color the
big block was, leaving the other 8 small blocks free to change their color between black
and white to make the whole QRcode resembles the halftone picture. This technique
works because for most of the The QRcode scanners, when they scan the QRcode, they
determine every block’s color only by the color of the block’s central smaller block.
Here comes 2 problems:</p>
<p>
Problem 1: Since we only divide every block into 9 blocksm the resolution is not high
when the QRcode’s version is small, which means there is not much data in the QRcode.</p>
<p>
Problem 2: When the QRcode’s data goes bigger, the scanner has trouble in
determining the central block’s color due to its limitation of the camera.</p>
<p>
The 2 problems interrelate. What I did is finding an algorithm that balance them.
My solution is to:</p>
<p>
Step 1: Divide every block into 5n×5n’s matrix instead of 3×3’s matrix, for example here,
25×25, and maintain the central n×n(in this example 5×5) matrix the original color. This
solves the problem 1, but deteriorates the problem 2, for we are now demanding the
scanner to distinct a small block which is the 1/25 of the big block. And I want to notify
here that on the other hand, a 1/25 sized block is small so that it can hide itself into the
background better than the small blocks in the original algorithm.
<p>
Step 2: Select part of the small blocks in the central 15×15 matrix(but not in the central
5×5 matrix) to be the original color(the same color given to the central 5×5), and all of the
not colored small blocks are free to be colored. The selecting function acts in the way that
the nearer the small block to the center, the more possible it be chosen. This step eases
the problem 2. To get a balance between the to problem, how many small blocks to select
is an attribute that can be controlled by the user.
There are still a lot more detail about this algorithm that can’t be demonstrated due to
the limitation of space, I have to leave them untouched.
The above is part of works I have done until now. There are still many other course
projects that I guess of less importance, and I think the above is enough to show my
capability and possibility in the study field of Information Architecture, especially in
Computer Graphics and Image Media.
