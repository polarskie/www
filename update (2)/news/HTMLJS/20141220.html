			<h2>An Electronic Commerce platform called QUGUANGJIE</h2>
			<section>
			<p>I built it with another partner and I was responsible for the php part and most pages of the website. 
			The platform provide user with a map showing what is on sale or hot at the moment as well as a searching function so that user 
			can find what they want immediately. The whole website is programmed without any existing library, just pure php, javascript, html5 and css3 to 
			reduce the web pagesâ€™ size to as small as possible and to make the running of the code as fast as possible so that users with a mobile phone 
			can get the best experience. Because this is not so related to my proposing field, the details is not demonstrated. </p>
